# Bankruptcy-Prediction-Model
Ensemble models in SAS Enterprise Miner
## One-Line Description
The PTSD Team developed a bankruptcy prediction model for a Kaggle Competition, utilizing an ensemble of Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting in SAS Enterprise Miner.

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a classification model to predict the likelihood of a company filing for bankruptcy. Developed as part of a Kaggle competition, the model is implemented in SAS Enterprise Miner and uses a combination of logistic regression and gradient boosting techniques. The process encompasses data cleaning, transformation, and model comparison to enhance prediction accuracy.
